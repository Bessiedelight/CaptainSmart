# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement focuses on improving the Expose Corner functionality in the CaptainSmart app. The current implementation has basic posting and voting capabilities connected to MongoDB, but needs several key improvements to provide a complete social media experience. The enhancements will focus on fixing existing errors, adding anonymous commenting functionality, implementing view tracking and other post metrics, and overall simplification of the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Error Resolution and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want all console errors and warnings to be resolved so that the application runs smoothly without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the expose corner page loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to unused imports or variables
2. WHEN users interact with the page THEN there SHALL be no JavaScript runtime errors
3. WHEN the page renders THEN all Link components SHALL have proper href attributes and navigation
4. IF there are unused imports or variables THEN the system SHALL remove them to clean up the codebase
5. WHEN the application runs THEN all TypeScript warnings SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 2: Anonymous Comments System

**User Story:** As an anonymous user, I want to be able to comment on expose posts so that I can engage with the content and share my thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view an expose post THEN I SHALL see a comment section below the post content
2. WHEN I click on the comment button THEN I SHALL see existing comments for that post
3. WHEN I want to add a comment THEN I SHALL be able to type in a comment input field without requiring authentication
4. WHEN I submit a comment THEN the system SHALL save it to the database with anonymous user identification
5. WHEN I submit a comment THEN it SHALL appear immediately in the comments list
6. WHEN other users view the post THEN they SHALL see all comments in chronological order
7. WHEN I submit a comment THEN the comment count SHALL increment and display the updated number
8. IF a comment is empty or only whitespace THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and show validation feedback
9. WHEN comments are displayed THEN each comment SHALL show a timestamp and anonymous identifier
10. WHEN there are many comments THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or load-more functionality

### Requirement 3: Post Metrics and Engagement Tracking

**User Story:** As a user viewing expose posts, I want to see accurate engagement metrics like view counts, comment counts, and share counts so that I can understand the popularity and engagement level of each post.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view an expose post THEN the system SHALL track and increment the view count
2. WHEN I view the expose feed THEN each post SHALL display the current view count
3. WHEN users comment on a post THEN the comment count SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN users vote on a post THEN the vote counts SHALL update immediately with optimistic UI updates
5. WHEN I share a post THEN the share count SHALL increment (if sharing functionality exists)
6. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN they SHALL use human-readable formatting (e.g., 1.2K, 2.5M)
7. WHEN I refresh the page THEN all metrics SHALL persist and display accurate counts
8. WHEN viewing posts THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate view counting from the same session
9. WHEN posts are sorted by trending THEN the algorithm SHALL consider views, comments, and votes
10. WHEN metrics are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected across all instances of the post

### Requirement 4: User Experience Simplification

**User Story:** As a user of the expose corner, I want the interface to be intuitive and responsive so that I can easily create, view, and interact with posts without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with vote buttons THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
2. WHEN I click on engagement buttons THEN the actions SHALL be clear and responsive
3. WHEN I view the comment section THEN it SHALL be easily accessible and well-organized
4. WHEN I navigate between posts THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent and predictable
5. WHEN I perform actions THEN loading states SHALL be clear and informative
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
7. WHEN I use the app on mobile THEN all functionality SHALL work seamlessly
8. WHEN I interact with posts THEN animations SHALL be smooth and enhance the experience
9. WHEN I view long content THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and readable
10. WHEN I access the expose corner THEN the overall performance SHALL be fast and responsive

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and API Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all user interactions and metrics to be properly stored and retrieved so that data integrity is maintained across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users comment on posts THEN comments SHALL be stored in MongoDB with proper indexing
2. WHEN view counts are incremented THEN they SHALL be persisted to the database
3. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the API SHALL return accurate and up-to-date information
4. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates correctly
5. WHEN data is retrieved THEN it SHALL include all necessary metadata for proper display
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and validation
7. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance
8. WHEN comments are fetched THEN they SHALL be properly paginated for large datasets
9. WHEN metrics are calculated THEN they SHALL use efficient database queries
10. WHEN data models are updated THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility
