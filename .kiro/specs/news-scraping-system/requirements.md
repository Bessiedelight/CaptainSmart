4. WHEN structuring extracted data THEN the system SHALL create clean JSON objects with all article metadata
5. WHEN adding metadata THEN the system SHALL include scraping timestamp and source URL for tracking purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want scraped articles to be processed by AI to create unique content while preserving image associations, so that the published content is original yet maintains visual context.

#### Acceptance Criteria
